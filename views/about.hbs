                         Hi! I am Harsimran and currently I am studying at Seneca Polytechnic College, Newnham Campus with Computer Programing Program. I am an international student and I live in Brampton, Ontario. I am in my third semester for this program. Since my childhood I am realy interested in computers So I decided to opt for this course. But I am also interested in Co-Curricular activities like indoor and outdoor games, gardening, singing, travelling and going for a walk in my free time. These activities help to boost my energy whenever I feel tired. I am an extrovert person who likes to interact with different people in college and at work place.
